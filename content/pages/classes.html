            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2gPeQGS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">About Sensors</a> (3:03) <h6>This is a short introduction to the world of sensors. I enumerate the sensors that I'll be showing you in this section, and then get straight into it!</h6></li>
            
            <li><a href="#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Measuring Light</a> (8:29) <h6>In this lecture, you will learn about how to detect and measure light using a photo-resistor. You will also learn about a common technique in electronics, the voltage divider. You will put all this in practice in a simple Arduino circuit.</h6></li>
            
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2ghURR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Temperature and humidity</a> (7:09)<h6>In this presentation you will learn how to measure temperature and humidity. To do this, we will use a sensor from the DHT family of temperature and humidity sensors. You will also learn about the dielectric property of certain materials, and of how to include an external software library to your Arduino sketch.</h6></li>   

            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2fUes8x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Barometric pressure sensors</a> (7:11)<h6>This presentation discusses barometric pressure and how you can measure it with the BPM085 sensor. You will also learn about the I2C communications interface that this sensor uses to communicate with the Arduino.</h6>

            <h6>PLEASE NOTE: A new sensor, BMP180, has been release as a drop-in replacement of the BPM085. The new device is a drop-in replacement of the old, so you can use the exact same connections schematic and library as described in this presentation. Also, Adafruit has released a new version of the library, compatible with both BPM085 and BPM180 with new useful features; I will be creating a new presentation showing how to use the new library.</h6></li>  

            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2fPVfdg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Infrared motion sensors</a> (9:04)<h6>In this presentation, we will connect a passive infrared sensor to our Arduino, calibrate it, and turn an LED on every time motion is detected.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2gR0HcW" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ultrasonic distance sensor</a> (10:11)<h6>In this presentation you will learn about how to measure distance using an ultrasonic distance sensor. This is a fairly sophisticated sensor that carries out a quite involved function when it comes to the physics of its implementation, however, as you will see, its application is as simple as it can be. You will also learn how to use a more advanced function of the Arduino language, the pulseIn function, through which you can time external events.</h6></li>
            
            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2fQmOD3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Detecting acceleration</a> (6:22)<h6>In this presentation, you will learn how to use a common 3-axis accelerometer, the ADXL335, to accurately measure the acceleration applied to an object. At the end of the presentation, you will be invited to create your first non-trivial circuit using this accelerometer.</h6></li>

            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2gipC8t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Line sensor (infrared)</a> (3:36)<h6>In this presentation, we look at the infrared line sensor, a sensor that can detect the reflection of infrared light that it emits of nearby objects. Sensors like this are used in toy robots, for detecting colour, tracking objects, even in measuring pulse in medical equipment.</h6></li>

            <li><a href="http://bit.ly/2gPVSTQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tilt and impact</a> (8:54)<h6>In this presentation, you will learn how to use a simple sensor that can detect the shock of an impact or being upside down. Even though in an earlier presentation we learned about the accelerometer, a sensor that can give us a lot of details about impact and the forces applied to it from which we can derive information about orientation, sometimes our needs are simple enough no not warrant using something as sophisticated as that. A simple switch that engages depending on its orientation or if something hits it is enough in such cases.</h6></li>

Although this was a simple way to show useful information to the user, the sheer number of wires required to make the LCD screen work makes this solution far from elegant.</h6><h6>In this lecture, you will learn a much improved solution to the same problem, one that involves a single data wire (plus power).</h6><h6>To achieve this reduction in total number of wires we have to switch the type of interface we use to connect the screen to the Arduino. Natively, the screen uses a parallel interface, where each of the 8 bits that make up a character encoding uses up a wire. In the previous class we used a 4-bit parallel mode instead of the full 8-bits in order to save 4 wires. Still, even 4 wires are too many for transferring data. We also needed wires for power, and for the screen backlit.</h6><h6>To improve the design, we'll use an adaptor that allows us to connect the parallel LCD screen to the Arduino using the I2C serial bus.</h6><h6>The adapter I'll use in the demos is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2h8e23u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1602LCD Display I2C board</a></h6></li>

        <h5>SD cards have matured over the years. Their sizes have expanded to many gigabytes, and their prices have dropped to a few cents per gigabyte. Compared to build-in memory, SD cards offer a really good mass storage solution. On the Arduino, an SD card can be used with the appropriate hardware extension and with an easy to use library that comes with the IDE. Your Arduino <a href="http://amzn.to/2gO6AtX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ethernet shield</a> comes with a micro-SD card slot, but you can also get them as a separate breakout board. In this class, we will use a dedicated, small and cheap break-out board.</h5>
