This 2-part presentation will show you how to connect and use and LCD character screen. In part 1, I'll show you how to wire up the screen and display a message on it. And in part 2, we'll connect a sensor and display its readings to the screen.</blockquote>
<b>Parts</b><br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
An LCD screen. See External Resources for an example from eBay. No need for a shield unless you really want to. Also, best NOT to buy an 2x8 screen since those come with their pins arranged in two rows which makes it a big pain to connect to your Arduino. When pins are arranged in two rows, you can't use a breadboard as is, you will need to make an adaptor. Avoid!</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In the LCD Presentation, you learned how to display text in a LCD screen. Although this was a simple way to show useful information to the user, the sheer number of wires required to make the LCD screen work makes this solution far from elegant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In this presentaion, I will show you a much improved solution to the same problem, one that involves a single data wire (plus power).</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To achieve this reduction in total number of wires we have to switch the type of interface we use to connect the screen to the Arduino. Natively, the screen uses a parallel interface, where each of the 8 bits that make up a character encoding uses up a wire. You may remember that in Presentation 24, use used a 4-bit parallel mode instead of the full 8-bits in order to save 4 wires. Still, even 4 wires are too many for transferring data. We also needed wires for power, and for the screen backlit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To improve the design, we'll use an adaptor that allows us to connect the parallel LCD screen to the Arduino using the I2C serial bus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The adapter I'll use in the demos is the 1602LCD Display I2C board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In this part 1, I'll show you how to connect the LCD adaptor to the screen and to the Arduino, and make sure it works.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In Part 2, I'll show you how to connect a second I2C device to the circuit from Demo 1 (in Part 1 of this presentation). The second device is a real-time clock.</blockquote>
