####Using Adafruits Fingerprint Sensor
  * In this presentation I demonstrate an easy-to-use fingerprint sensor. This sensor is internally a sophisticated device, that contains a 32-bit microprocessor dedicated to do digital signal processing of fingerprint images. A library developed by Adafruit makes this sensor very easy to use. Connect it to your Arduino using serial or software serial pins, and you can start enrolling and recognising fingerprints within minutes.

  * In the second part, I show you how to connect the device to the Arduino and enroll and recognize fingerprints using a couple of the included sketches. In the third part I show you a small demo application that involves an electric door lock. I use the fingerprint sensor to energise the coil in the door lock and grand or deny access to my lab (when eventually the lock is installed to my door).

With this module you can achieve reliable point to point communications. We are showing you the basics so you can go on creating sophisticated wireless systems, including mesh sensor arrays!

####Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  * In this 4-part class you will learn about Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is a relatively new member of the Bluetooth standard, and has been responsible for the emergence of countless low-power mobile and wireless devices, like activity trackers, wireless headphones, lost item locators etc.

  * In this 2nd part, we will look at the the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011OZXZW4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B011OZXZW4&linkCode=as2&tag=hackerspacetech-20&linkId=62117c475b58ba3bcc8ff04c96e592d0">Adafruit nRF8001 BLE module</a>, and wire it to the Arduino.

####Using An SD Card
  * In this 3-part class, we will show you how to take advantage of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NAY2NAI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NAY2NAI&linkCode=as2&tag=hackerspacetech-20&linkId=55deb5d39a78f6cf84cd24e34ad76e33">SD card mass storage using a cheap breakout.</a>

  * SD cards have matured over the years. Their sizes have expanded to many gigabytes, and their prices have dropped to a few cents per gigabyte. Compared to build-in memory, SD cards offer a really good mass storage solution. On the Arduino, an SD card can be used with the appropriate hardware extension and with an easy to use library that comes with the IDE. Your Arduino <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AXVX5D0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AXVX5D0&linkCode=as2&tag=hackerspacetech-20&linkId=92bfdde8986e82d64e39cb7062e2c000">Ethernet shield</a> comes with a micro-SD card slot, but you can also get them as a separate breakout board. In this class, we will use a dedicated, small and cheap break-out board.

####Using EEPROM
  * EEPROM stands for “Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory”, and you can use it to store data that must be preserved even after power is lost. You could use EEPROM to store configuration values for your sketch that the user can modify, passwords, sensor logs and things of that sort.

  * In this first demo, we'll use two sketches to write and read a pin number for a basic security system. The writing sketch will write the default pin in a specific internal EEPROM memory location, and the reading sketch will simply go to that location and read back the pin. Keeping things simple, we are not going to worry about LCD screens, a keypad for the pin entry, or encryption for storing the pin securely.

####Hardware Interrupts
  * This class will show you how to use the hardware interrupt. In the this class, I will also show you how to use a relevant feature called the Time Interrupt. A hardware interrupt provides the ability to tie a special pin with a function in your sketch that will be executed with priority when the state of the pin changes in a particular way.

  * In this first demo, we'll take the circuit from the button class and only modify the sketch it so that the LED is lit as a response to an interrupt generated by the button, instead of by polling the state of the button a few million times per second.

####Using a Real Time Clock
  * In this 2-part class, we will show you how to use a typical real time clock with your Arduino. We will be using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GH0WURM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01GH0WURM&linkCode=as2&tag=hackerspacetech-20&linkId=b368707574e52d214f9d775b0864559a">DFRobot DS1307 RTC breakout</a>. This device, like many others, is based on the popular DS1307 clock IC, and it can do anything you would expect a good clock can do. It counts seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, goes up to 2100 and compensates for leap years.

  * In this class part 1, you will learn how to connect the RTC module to the Arduino, set the time, and read the time from it. In class part 2, I show how to time-stamp sensor readings and store them in an SD card.
