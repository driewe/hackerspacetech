<blockquote>
In this presentation I demonstrate an easy-to-use fingerprint sensor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This sensor is internally a sophisticated device, that contains a 32-bit microprocessor dedicated to do digital signal processing of fingerprint images.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A library developed by Adafruit makes this sensor very easy to use. Connect it to your Arduino using serial or software serial pins, and you can start enrolling and recognising fingerprints within minutes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In this first part of the presentation, I discuss the device and its features.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In the second part, I show you how to connect the device to the Arduino and enroll and recognize fingerprints using a couple of the included sketches.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the third part I show you a small demo application that involves an electric door lock.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I use the fingerprint sensor to energise the coil in the door lock and grand or deny access to my lab (when eventually the lock is installed to my door).</blockquote>
