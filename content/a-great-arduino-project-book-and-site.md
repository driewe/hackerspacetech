I received a message on twitter asking if I knew how to test if a GSM
Sim900 module was working.  I have not worked with that module hands on
but did recall a great write up on it from a trusted source, John Boxall
of [http://tronixstuff.com](http://tronixstuff.com).  I learned of John through Arduinos site under [Mannuals and Curriculum](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ManualsAndCurriculum). His
book, [Arduino Workshop](http://goo.gl/0DeHZJ), was listed right
along with Massimo Banzi's [Getting Started With
Arduino](http://goo.gl/5gTuHz).

What impressed me most with this book is that all 65 of the projects
from the book can be found on the authors website along with videos
documenting his build of the project.

http://tronixstuff.com/.  Actually, each of the projects from the book
are well documented on the site and has great educational content on
it's own.
