This is a really cool project that was originally on Make as a [GPS Cat Tracker](http://makezine.com/projects/make-37/gps-cat-tracker-2/). Michael James, at the [Programming Electronics Academy](http://electronics.ontraport.com/t?orid=9558&opid=1), put together an excellent 10 minute video showing you how easy it is to do this project.
