        <p>We will be starting a comprehensive 35 week workshop series designed for anyone interested in learning electronic design and microcontroller programming. No experience is required, and all you need is an Arduino and several low-cost components. The workshops will start on Jan 4th, 2017 and run weekly through Aug 30th, 2017.</p>
        <p>With over 20 hours of content in 110 lectures and hands on help from skilled professionals this workshop series will take you from zero experience in electronics or programming to Arduino Master. NOTE:  What you learn in this series can be taken to ANY other development platform.  We use the Arduino for it popularity and community support</p><br>
        <h4>What will it cost?</h4>
        <p>This workshop series is free to the general public, membership at TheLabMS is not required.  However, space is limited to 20 participants so you will want to reserver your spot for the classes you wish to attend.  You will also need to bring your own laptop, Arduino and parts if you wish to particpate in the lab work.  Participants may also choose to watch the presentation then observe or partner with others that are doing the labs.</p><br>
        <h4>Do I need to attend all events</h4>
        <p>No, you can pick and chose.  It is recommended to register via the meetup page so your spot is reserved</p>
        <p>Here is a current list of scheduled workshops. Clicking on the title will take you to the meetup where you can learn more about the event and RSVP</p>
