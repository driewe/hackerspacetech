I received the followinng email from Peter Dalmaris:
--------------
Today I feel particularly excited to announce that I have just published my new course! 

[Arduino Step by Step 2017 Getting Started](http://bit.ly/sbs2017coupon)

I have designed the new course especially for people new to the Arduino, electronics, and programming.

While the original Arduino Step by Step is still a great resource for Arduino Makers, I felt that it does not cater specifically to the needs of people who are just starting.

I packed the original Arduino Step by Step with content that helped you build amazing things. I also packed Arduino Step by Step 2017 Getting Started with content that will take you from a total beginner to confident, independent learner.

The new course is full of experiments, Brain Stretcher exercises, prompts for further study, and end of section quizzes. 

I have also dramatically improved the technical course quality, with full 1080p video and crystal clear audio in every single lecture.

I invite you to [view my promotional video and read through the course page](http://bit.ly/sbs2017coupon) for more details about Arduino Step by Step 2017 Getting Started.

I am sure you will like what you see!

For one week, until January 2, 2017, you can purchase Arduino Step by Step 2017 Getting Started for just **$10**. (see links below)

Are you unsure about the differences and similarities between **Arduino Step by Step 2017 Getting Started** and **Arduino Step by Step Your Complete Guide?** I have created a side-by-side comparison table so that you can work out with confidence which one is best suited for you. You can find this table in the [course page](http://bit.ly/sbs2017coupon) (scroll down a bit).

**The newer course does not replace the older one, it complements it! I fully support, and I am committed to both.**

If you are not sure whether this course is appropriate for you, remember that you have 30 days during which you can request a no-questions-asked refund (though I do appreciate your feedback).

#### My offer does not end with Arduino SbS 2017 GS! I am happy to offer you all of my other courses for just **US$10 each**, also until January 2, 2017. To take advantage of this offer, please  use the links below:
