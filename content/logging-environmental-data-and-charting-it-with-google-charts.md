Today I have been experimenting with the Particle Photon and logging environment data to the internet via the Data.SparkFun.com. Data.SparkFun.com is a free service for posting, storing, and reading sets of data. It’s powered by Phant, an open-source, Node.js-based tool that can be run on any server or computer. Once the data data feed has some data  I can start charting it using a number of free services. Following Sparkfuns tutorial I am using Googles Charts to graph live data on my web site. Adding a barometric sensor to this wouldn't be hard and would make for some interesting weather studies.
